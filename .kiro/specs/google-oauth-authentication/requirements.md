# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Google OAuth authentication system in the TTSAI language learning application. The system will provide secure user authentication, session management, and user profile handling using Google Sign-In OAuth 2.0. The enhancement focuses on completing the frontend integration, improving security measures, and ensuring seamless user experience across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can access the language learning features without creating a separate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a Google Sign-In button on the login page
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google Sign-In button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user grants permission THEN the system SHALL receive the authorization code and exchange it for user information
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with Google profile data
5. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL store user ID, name, email, and profile picture in the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can access my existing learning progress and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an existing user signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL verify their Google ID against the database
2. WHEN a user is found THEN the system SHALL update their last login timestamp and profile information
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token for session management
4. WHEN a JWT token is created THEN the system SHALL include user ID, name, and email in the token payload
5. WHEN the token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh mechanism to extend the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to be maintained across page refreshes, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly during my learning session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token securely in the browser
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL validate the stored token and maintain the session
3. WHEN a token is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically restore the user's authentication state
4. WHEN a token is expired THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh it automatically
5. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access protected features of the application, so that I can use personalized learning tools and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a protected route THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected features
3. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include the JWT token in the Authorization header
5. WHEN the backend receives a request THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token before processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view and update my profile information, so that I can manage my account details and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display their Google profile information
2. WHEN profile data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show name, email, and profile picture
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL save changes to the database
4. WHEN profile updates are saved THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately in the UI
5. WHEN profile data is outdated THEN the system SHALL sync with Google profile during next login

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to sign out of the application, so that I can protect my account when using shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL invalidate their current session
2. WHEN logout is initiated THEN the system SHALL remove the JWT token from browser storage
3. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all user-specific data from the application state
5. WHEN logout occurs THEN the system SHALL optionally revoke the Google OAuth token

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be secure and compliant, so that user data is protected and the application meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage
2. WHEN validating tokens THEN the system SHALL verify token signatures and expiration times
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
4. WHEN communicating with Google APIs THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and validate SSL certificates
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for authentication flows, so that users receive helpful feedback when authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options for authentication
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and prompt re-authentication
4. WHEN authentication errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for resolution
