# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTSAI application is currently experiencing various bugs and errors in both the frontend and backend components. This feature aims to identify, categorize, and fix all existing issues to ensure a stable, reliable application that functions as expected. The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run (backend) and Netlify (frontend), and we need to address all issues affecting the production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fix all 404 errors in the backend API endpoints, so that users can access all learning tool features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the word-of-day endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate data instead of a 404 error
2. WHEN a user submits a quiz THEN the system SHALL process the submission instead of returning a 404 error
3. WHEN a user accesses any learning tools endpoint THEN the system SHALL respond with the appropriate data instead of a 404 error
4. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL include all the latest code with learning tools endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fix all 503 Service Unavailable errors, so that users can reliably use the translation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend service is running THEN the system SHALL properly connect to the Gemini API
2. WHEN the environment is set up THEN the system SHALL have the correct API key configured
3. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL have sufficient resources allocated to handle requests
4. WHEN a user makes a translation request THEN the system SHALL respond without 503 errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the database is properly initialized and populated, so that features like word-of-day work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL populate it with required word-of-day data for all supported languages
2. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL populate it with common phrases data
3. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create necessary tables for user progress tracking
4. WHEN a user accesses word-of-day THEN the system SHALL return data from the database without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fix frontend resource loading errors, so that users don't see console errors about missing files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL not show errors for missing manifest icons
2. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL properly load all required CSS and JavaScript resources
3. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL not display any 404 errors in the browser console

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the romanization feature works correctly, so that users can see Latin script versions of non-Latin script translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user translates text to a non-Latin script language THEN the system SHALL provide romanization
2. WHEN romanization is provided THEN the system SHALL indicate which romanization system was used
3. WHEN a user copies romanization text THEN the system SHALL copy the text to the clipboard correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the avatar conversation system works correctly, so that users can practice language with personality-driven AI avatars.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an avatar THEN the system SHALL start a conversation session with that avatar
2. WHEN a user sends a message to an avatar THEN the system SHALL respond with personality-consistent responses
3. WHEN an avatar responds THEN the system SHALL include educational features like vocabulary and grammar tips
4. WHEN a user changes language THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate avatars for that language

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement comprehensive error handling and logging, so that future errors can be quickly identified and fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the error
2. WHEN an API request fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages
3. WHEN the frontend encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include context information to aid debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement automated testing and monitoring, so that issues can be detected before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL run automated tests to verify functionality
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the failure
3. WHEN the system is running THEN the system SHALL monitor key endpoints for availability
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the UI modernization is properly implemented, so that users have a consistent, attractive interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL display the modern gradient-based design
2. WHEN a user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display correctly with responsive design
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL adapt the gradient system appropriately
