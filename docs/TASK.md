# TTSAI Tasks

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 2024-12-02
- [x] Set up project documentation (PLANNING.md, TASK.md)
- [x] Analyzed backend and frontend structure
- [x] Identified critical issues with learning tools
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Added missing basic `/api/translate` endpoint
- [x] **HIGH**: Fixed flashcard creation validation (supports both nested and flat data)
- [x] **MEDIUM**: Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- [x] **FIXED**: Learning tools tests now pass locally (5/5 tests)
- [x] **DEPLOYED**: Successfully redeployed backend to Google Cloud Run
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Basic translation and advanced translation working on production

## üîß Current Issues to Fix

### Backend Issues (Production)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Word of day endpoint returning "Language en not supported" on production
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Database initialization for learning tools on production deployment
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Flashcards endpoint returning list instead of object on production

### Frontend Issues  
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Update API calls to handle both basic and advanced translation
- [ ] **LOW**: Improve error handling in learning tools components

### Testing Issues
- [x] **HIGH**: Fix learning tools tests by ensuring proper backend startup ‚úÖ
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add unit tests for new translation endpoint
- [ ] **LOW**: Add integration tests for learning tools workflow

## üìã Discovered During Work

### Backend Architecture Issues
- ‚úÖ Missing basic translation endpoint that frontend/tests expect - **FIXED**
- The backend has grown to 1558 lines in app.py (violates 500-line rule) - **NEEDS REFACTORING**
- ‚úÖ Database service exists and works locally - **CONFIRMED**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production deployment has data initialization issues

### Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ **Docker build and push successful**
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Run deployment completed**
- ‚úÖ **Health check endpoint working (200 OK)**
- ‚úÖ **Basic and advanced translation endpoints working**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Learning tools have data issues on production**

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ **Local testing: 5/5 learning tools tests pass**
- ‚úÖ **Production testing: 3/3 translation tests pass**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production testing: Learning tools have data issues**

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Fix production data initialization for learning tools
- [ ] Split large backend file into modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### Long Term  
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement advanced learning analytics
- [ ] Add mobile app support
- [ ] Implement offline functionality

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Health check endpoint
- Basic translation (/api/translate)
- Advanced translation (/api/advanced-translate)
- Romanization for non-Latin scripts
- Local learning tools (all tests pass)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues in Production
- Word of day data not populated
- Flashcard data structure inconsistency
- Possible database migration issues

### üéØ Next Priority
Fix production data initialization to make learning tools fully functional on the deployed backend.
