# TTSAI Tasks

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 2024-12-28
- [x] Set up project documentation (PLANNING.md, TASK.md)
- [x] Analyzed backend and frontend structure
- [x] Identified critical issues with learning tools

## ðŸ”§ Current Issues to Fix

### Backend Issues
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add missing basic `/api/translate` endpoint
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix database initialization for learning tools
- [ ] **HIGH**: Ensure data directory and JSON files are properly created
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add proper error handling for missing environment variables

### Frontend Issues  
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Update API calls to handle both basic and advanced translation
- [ ] **LOW**: Improve error handling in learning tools components

### Testing Issues
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix learning tools tests by ensuring proper backend startup
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add unit tests for new translation endpoint
- [ ] **LOW**: Add integration tests for learning tools workflow

## ðŸ“‹ Discovered During Work

### Backend Architecture Issues
- The backend has grown to 1433 lines in app.py (violates 500-line rule)
- Missing basic translation endpoint that frontend/tests expect
- Database service exists but may not be properly initialized
- Learning tools endpoints exist but may have startup issues

### Frontend Issues  
- Frontend components may be too large (need to check line counts)
- API error handling could be improved
- Learning tools integration needs verification

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Split large backend file into modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### Long Term  
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement advanced learning analytics
- [ ] Add mobile app support
- [ ] Implement offline functionality
