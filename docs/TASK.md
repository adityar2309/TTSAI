# TTSAI Tasks

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 2024-12-02
- [x] Set up project documentation (PLANNING.md, TASK.md)
- [x] Analyzed backend and frontend structure
- [x] Identified critical issues with learning tools
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Added missing basic `/api/translate` endpoint
- [x] **HIGH**: Fixed flashcard creation validation (supports both nested and flat data)
- [x] **MEDIUM**: Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- [x] **FIXED**: Learning tools tests now pass locally (5/5 tests)
- [x] **DEPLOYED**: Successfully redeployed backend to Google Cloud Run
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Basic translation and advanced translation working on production
- [x] **ENHANCED**: Updated deploy script with better error handling and validation
- [x] **IMPROVED**: Created PowerShell deploy script (deploy.ps1) for better Windows compatibility
- [x] **ROBUST**: Enhanced database initialization with fallback data creation

## 🔧 Current Issues to Fix

### Backend Issues (Production)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Test word-of-day endpoint after latest deployment
- [ ] **LOW**: Monitor database performance in production

### Frontend Issues  
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Update frontend API_BASE_URL to point to new deployment
- [ ] **LOW**: Improve error handling in learning tools components

### Testing Issues
- [x] **FIXED**: Learning tools tests working with improved error handling
- [ ] **LOW**: Add integration tests for all learning endpoints

## 🚀 Deployment Improvements Made

### Enhanced Deploy Scripts
1. **deploy.bat** (Windows Batch)
   - ✅ Prerequisites checking (gcloud CLI, authentication)
   - ✅ Environment variable validation
   - ✅ Better error handling and rollback
   - ✅ Automatic health checking
   - ✅ Improved resource allocation (2Gi RAM, 2 CPU)
   - ✅ Production environment configuration

2. **deploy.ps1** (PowerShell)
   - ✅ Advanced error handling with try-catch
   - ✅ Colored output for better visibility
   - ✅ Automatic test file URL updating
   - ✅ Command-line parameters (SkipTests, Force)
   - ✅ Interactive prompts for safety

### Backend Fixes
- ✅ **Database Initialization**: More robust with fallback word creation
- ✅ **Environment Handling**: Graceful degradation without GEMINI_API_KEY
- ✅ **API Compatibility**: Fixed flashcard endpoint response format
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Better logging and error responses

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### Using the Enhanced Deploy Scripts

#### Option 1: Batch Script (deploy.bat)
```cmd
# Simple deployment
deploy.bat

# The script will:
# - Check all prerequisites
# - Validate environment variables
# - Build and push Docker image
# - Deploy to Cloud Run
# - Test the deployment
# - Show next steps
```

#### Option 2: PowerShell Script (deploy.ps1) - Recommended
```powershell
# Normal deployment with testing
.\deploy.ps1

# Skip health testing (faster)
.\deploy.ps1 -SkipTests

# Force deployment without environment variable prompts
.\deploy.ps1 -Force

# Both options
.\deploy.ps1 -SkipTests -Force
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables
```powershell
# Set GEMINI_API_KEY for full functionality
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"

# Or for persistent setting
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GEMINI_API_KEY", "your_actual_api_key_here", "User")
```

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Test the updated deployment with `.\deploy.ps1`
2. Verify all learning tools endpoints are working
3. Update frontend if API URL changed
4. Monitor production performance

## 📋 Discovered During Work

### Backend Architecture Issues
- ✅ Missing basic translation endpoint that frontend/tests expect - **FIXED**
- The backend has grown to 1558 lines in app.py (violates 500-line rule) - **NEEDS REFACTORING**
- ✅ Database service exists and works locally - **CONFIRMED**
- ⚠️ Production deployment has data initialization issues

### Deployment Status
- ✅ **Docker build and push successful**
- ✅ **Cloud Run deployment completed**
- ✅ **Health check endpoint working (200 OK)**
- ✅ **Basic and advanced translation endpoints working**
- ⚠️ **Learning tools have data issues on production**

### Testing Results
- ✅ **Local testing: 5/5 learning tools tests pass**
- ✅ **Production testing: 3/3 translation tests pass**
- ⚠️ **Production testing: Learning tools have data issues**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Fix production data initialization for learning tools
- [ ] Split large backend file into modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### Long Term  
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement advanced learning analytics
- [ ] Add mobile app support
- [ ] Implement offline functionality

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- Health check endpoint
- Basic translation (/api/translate)
- Advanced translation (/api/advanced-translate)
- Romanization for non-Latin scripts
- Local learning tools (all tests pass)

### ⚠️ Issues in Production
- Word of day data not populated
- Flashcard data structure inconsistency
- Possible database migration issues

### 🎯 Next Priority
Fix production data initialization to make learning tools fully functional on the deployed backend.
